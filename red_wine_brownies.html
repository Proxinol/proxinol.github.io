Ingredients

    1/2 cup butter
    4 tbsp butter
    12 tbsp cocoa powder
    12 tbsp brown sugar
    1 1/2 cups light or medium brown sugar
    2 eggs, room temperature
    3/4 cup cocoa powder
    1/4 cup all-purpose flour
    1/2 teaspoon salt
    1 teaspoon vanilla extract
    1/4 cup red wine

Instructions

    Preheat oven to 350°F. Line an 8″x8″ baking dish with parchment paper or oil.
    In a small saucepan over low heat, melt the butter. 
    Once melted, add in 12 tbsp of cocoa and 12 tbsp of sugar, whisk until smooth.
    In a bowl add in the rest of the brown sugar. 
    Slowly pour melted chocolate mixture into brown sugar while mixing. 
    Add in eggs, one at a time, while still beating. 
    Beat for 30 seconds, until the color of the batter lightens just a bit.
    Beat slowly and add in cocoa powder, flour, salt, vanilla extract, and wine, beating for an additional 30 seconds.
    Pour batter into prepared pan and bake for roughly 40 mins, or until a knife comes out clean.
